# Mortality Prediction for Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) Patients 

## Aim 
To develop Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models for in-hospital mortality prediction of ACS patients

## Methodology 
Perform on data collection, data preprocessing, data splitting, models’ development, features selection, models’ performance evaluation, comparison and analysis

## Data
The National Cardiovascular Disease Database (NCVD ACS) registry from 2006-2017


## Result and Discussion
##### DL(SVM selected var)(14 variables) is chosen the as the final predictive model due to: 
i)   Highest AUC and Sensitivity when predicting both STEMI and NSTEMI mortality <br>
ii)  Best performance in making correct predictions on mortality cases for high-risk patients <br> 
iii) Achieved a statistically significant performance
